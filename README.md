# Spiking Activity in Neurons with Diffusion Modeling Across Neural Regions

This repository contains code and resources for Noah Fosters course project for STAT 8201 Statistical Analysis of Neural Data and STAT 6701 Probabilistic Models and Machine Learning at Columbia University for professor Liam Paninski and David Blei respectively.

This project applies diffusion models (mostly Latent Diffusion Models inspired by LDNS: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08751) to the Spike Train Infill Problem (as tackled by NeuroPaint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11924).
